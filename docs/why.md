# Why action-u?

This section provides some insight into why action-u was
created, and how it compares to other similar utilities.

There are several popular action-based helper utilities, such as
[redux-actions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-actions).

Not only does action-u auto generate your {{book.ext.actionCreators}},
and promote their corresponding action types, but it introduces
organization to your actions through the JSON-based
{{book.api.ActionStruct}}.  This {{book.api.ActionStruct}} is a unique
aspect of action-u, it:
- implicitly defines your action types, 
- instinctively groups related actions,
- and seamlessly promotes both {{book.ext.actionCreators}} and types throughout
  your application.

The action-u library was pulled from a sandbox project
([GeekU](https://github.com/KevinAst/GeekU)) that I use to study
several technologies and frameworks.

I hope you enjoy this effort, and comments are always welcome.
