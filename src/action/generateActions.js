/**
 * @typedef {JSON} ActionGenesis
 * 
 * ActionGenesis is a JSON meta structure (used by {@link generateActions})
 * that provides the master definition for the machine-generated
 * {@link ActionStruct}, promoting one or more action creators and types.
 * 
 * - The structure is app-specific and can employ depth to highlight
 *   inner-relationships between various action creators.
 * 
 * - Ultimately the structure defines one or more action creator
 *   function nodes.  Each of these nodes promote:
 * 
 *   * the action creator function itself, and
 * 
 *   * the action type, which is implicitly gleaned from the containing JSON
 *     structure node accumulation (ex: `'widget.fetch'`)
 * 
 * - Nodes containing an `actionMeta` property define an ActionNode
 *   (i.e. an action creator).
 * 
 *   * The resultant corresponding node will be an action creator
 *     function.  The characteristics of this function is further
 *     defined by `actionMeta` sub-properties (see {@link ActionMeta}).
 * 
 *   * The action type is implied from the containing JSON structure
 *     node accumulation (ex: `'widget.fetch.complete'`) and is promoted through
 *     a string coercion of the action creator function itself
 *     (i.e. the function's toString() has been overloaded).
 * 
 * - All other nodes are merely intermediate nodes that organize
 *   (i.e. add meaning) to the overall shape of the promoted actions.
 *   In the example below, `widget` is an intermediate node (i.e. it
 *   is not an action creator).
 * 
 * - Note that even ActionNodes may in turn contain sub-structure
 *   (i.e. subordinate actions).  In the example below,
 *   `widget.fetch(selCrit)` is an action creator, an yet contains
 *   subordinate actions: `widget.fetch.complete(widget)`.
 * 
 * @example <caption>showing a standard set of fetch/complete/fail actions</caption>
 * {
 *   widget: {
 *     fetch: {      actionMeta: {
 *                     traits: ['selCrit']
 *                   },
 *       complete: { actionMeta: {
 *                     traits: ['widget']
 *                   }
 *       },
 *       fail: {     actionMeta: {
 *                     traits: ['err']
 *                   }
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }

/**
 * @typedef {JSON} ActionMeta
 * 
 * An ActionMeta is a sub-node (named `actionMeta`) in the

 * Supported properties of ActionMeta are:
 *
 * @property {string[]} traits - An array of names that serve BOTH as
 * the:
 * <li>expected parameter names of the action creator</li>
 * <li>and the Action property names (returned from the action creator)</li>
 * When NO `traits` property is supplied, the Action merely has NO properties
 * other than it's `type` [of course]).
 *
 * @property {ratifyFn} ratify - An optional hook to validate and/or

 * When NO `ratify` function is supplied, only simple validation is
 * performed (ex: the number of arguments supplied)

 *
 * - default parameters are accomplished by applying default semantics
 *   and returning the arguments
 * 
 * @param {...*} args - the parameters to this function should match
